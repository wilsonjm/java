#Contributing

Like with Clojure and most other big OSS projects, we have a [Contributor's Agreement](https://docs.google.com/a/kodowa.com/forms/d/1ME_PT6qLKUcALUEz1h1yerLF7vP_Rnohpb9RvMLDALg/viewform) that you have to agree to before we can merge. It's a simple adaptation of Twitter's own Contributor's Agreement and just says that by signing this you can't take the code back from us or sue us into oblivion for using it later.

#Plugins

Many things are better off implemented as plugins to Light Table since plugins have the same degree of power that any code in the core does. This allows us to keep the base of Light Table small and manageable and foster a large ecosystem on a solid foundation. Instead of tracking feature/plugin requests in the core, we'll track them in the [wishlist](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/Feature-wishlist) part of the wiki.
